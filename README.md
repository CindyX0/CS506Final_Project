Description of the project.
Conduct exploratory analysis on what factors influence the health(emotional,mental, physical) and satisfaction(including happiness) of relationships between married couples. What factors are strongly correlated with healthier and happier relationships? Are there any patterns we notice in unhealthy relationships when it comes to spouse behavior?
The categories that would be interesting to explore are general relationship health & satisfaction, emotional & mental Health in Relationships, physical health & relationship quality, conflict & unhealthy relationship patterns, external influences on relationships, gender & role dynamics in relationships and predictiong relationship succsess/ struggle

The data is available online for public use , however it needs to be engineered to include variables that are more relevant to the questions being asked and refine into a subset of data that can be easier to workwith.
Modeling Options: Linear/Logistic  Regression, Decion Trees
Visualization: Bar plot, Scatter plot, Heat Maps, line graphs, area graphs, I also want to create an interactive where we can see different facotrs on happiness/satisfaction/ health
Test plan: the conventional 80/20 rule , 20 used to train and 80 used to test. I also want to validate the models create with acccuracy, precision, recall and  f1 scores
